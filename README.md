# ReadMe for the Cyber Bootcamp Repo (cyberboot) 
Welcome to my repo!  This repo was created to house all the scripts that I wrote during the course of SavvyCoder's Cybersecurtiy +Ops bootcamp, which I attended from Nov 2022 to Mar 2023.
I originally enrolled in this bootcamp to increase the likelihood of getting a job in the IT/Cybersecurity industry.  I've long been interested in computers, specifically automation and security, so this type of learning was right up my alley.
Ops 201, specifically, taught many fundamentals of cosing, both in PowerShell and Bash, that really emphasised how powerful automation can be.
My favorite challenge was one where the information for a specific domain name was returned in a text file.  So much information was returned with just a few lines of code and an input.
Any type of automation that allows a user to complete tasks easily and without knowing the ins and outs of the program makes everyone more efficient.
I plan on continuing to write scripts that will automate repetitive task, not just at work but in my home environment
In the future, I hope to become more adept at PowerShell, as my current role works in a Windows environment, as well as adding some Python to my repertoire
